# Overview

This directory contains some sample implementations of the `Player.cls` class.
These players are based on those discussed in the paper [Elo World, a framework for benchmarking weak chess engines](http://tom7.org/chess/weak.pdf) by Tom Murphy VII.

Simply put, they are weak, simple algorithms for playing chess that are easy to understand.
Thus, they illustrate how to implement a player for the required interface of the library in the parent directory.
